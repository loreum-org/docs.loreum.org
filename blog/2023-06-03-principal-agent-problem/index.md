The principal-agent problem, also known as the agency problem, is a concept in economics and corporate governance that refers to the potential conflicts of interest that can arise between the principal (or owner) and the agent (or manager) who is appointed to act on behalf of the principal.

The principal-agent relationship typically occurs when one party (the principal) delegates decision-making authority or control over certain tasks to another party (the agent). The principal relies on the agent to make decisions that are aligned with their interests, but there is often an information asymmetry between the two parties, with the agent possessing more knowledge and information about the specific details and circumstances of the tasks at hand.

The principal-agent problem arises because the agent may not always act in the best interests of the principal. Instead, the agent may pursue their own self-interest or diverge from the principal's objectives due to various reasons, such as personal incentives, different risk preferences, or moral hazard.

For example, in a corporation, shareholders (the principals) appoint managers (the agents) to run the company on their behalf. However, managers may prioritize their own compensation, job security, or personal goals, which may not always align with maximizing shareholder value. This misalignment of interests can lead to conflicts, such as excessive executive compensation, shirking of responsibilities, or the pursuit of short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainability.

The principal-agent problem is pervasive in various contexts, including corporate governance, politics, public administration, and even everyday situations where one person delegates tasks to another. It is a fundamental challenge in designing effective mechanisms, such as contracts, incentives, and monitoring systems, to align the interests of principals and agents and mitigate the potential conflicts that may arise.
